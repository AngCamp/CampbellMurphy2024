    "In the scripts in ExtractingSWRs I have provided an example of a pipeline to call data from the ABI and IBL then run through the LFP and associated meta data and return csvs with times of putative ripple events and various other metrics about the ripples.  But it can be useful to visualize the detectors results both to build your own and modify the code.  Visualization of the results of the detector are important to ensure there are not small bugs in your code and that teh data itself is nice.  It is not only useful to visulize events you are detecting but also artifacts that may prevent detection or produce false positives.  "

    "The ExtractSWR scripts saved the channel in each probes CA1 LFP with the highest ripple band power.  It has already been reinterpolated from ~1250 Hz to 1500 Hz for use with the Frank Lab filter.  Note each probe has a slightly different sampling frequency which can be found in it's meta data.  I will show how to use the meta data to identify probes of interest but we will load the saved LFP data to make sure our detector is working properly. "
